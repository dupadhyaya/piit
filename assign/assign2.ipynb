    "##  ‚úÖ Evaluation Criteria:\n",
    "- Evaluation framework you can use for this Google Sheets practice assignment so students are graded not only on correctness but also on efficiency, clarity, and real-world application skills.\n",
    "    1. Formula Accuracy & Logic (40%)\n",
    "        - Correct Functions Used (20%)\n",
    "        - Matches the intended function(s) for each task (e.g., VLOOKUP for lookup, COUNTIFS for multiple conditions, INDEX/MATCH when required).\n",
    "        - No unnecessary helper columns unless justified.\n",
    "        - Logical Correctness (20%)\n",
    "        - Formula produces correct and complete results for all cases, not just sample rows.\n",
    "        - Handles edge cases (e.g., IFERROR for missing IDs, attendance exactly at 75%, scores = 40).\n",
    "    2. Efficiency & Best Practices (20%)\n",
    "        - Efficient Formula Structure (10%)\n",
    "        - Avoids overly long, repetitive formulas when a simpler alternative exists.\n",
    "        - Uses absolute/relative references correctly.\n",
    "        - Appropriate Use of Built-in Functions (10%)\n",
    "        - Leverages Google Sheets‚Äô features like UNIQUE(), FILTER(), SORT(), AVERAGEIFS() instead of manual workarounds.\n",
    "   3. Data Presentation & Formatting (20%)\n",
    "       - Readability (10%)\n",
    "       - Clear column headers, consistent naming.\n",
    "       - No broken references, unnecessary blank cells, or truncated results.\n",
    "       - Formatting for Insight (10%)\n",
    "       - Conditional formatting for Pass/Fail or targets met.\n",
    "       - Number/date formats consistent and appropriate.\n",
    "    4. Interpretation & Insights (20%)\n",
    "        - Meaningful Output (10%)\n",
    "        - Results are not just numbers‚Äîstudents understand what the data is showing.\n",
    "        - Optional Commentary (10%)\n",
    "        - Short text or note explaining trends (e.g., ‚ÄúPhysics average in 12A is below target‚Äù or ‚ÄúAttendance is a concern for 5 students‚Äù).\n",
    "### Marks aren‚Äôt just for ‚Äúgetting the right answer‚Äù‚Äîthey‚Äôre also for how cleanly and intelligently you get there, and whether you can communicate the meaning of your findings"
